# Artifacts (not versioned)

Use this folder to stash large or generated files (ROOT outputs, logs, PDF bundles, SLURM tarballs) that should stay local and out of git. Existing run outputs were left in place under `outputs/` but are now ignored; move anything you want to keep permanently into here.
